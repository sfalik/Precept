# Steinbrenner Final Point Decision

- Date: 2026-04-05
- Branch: `feature/language-redesign`
- Decision: Treat the outstanding `docs\HowWeGotHere.md` addition as a coherent single final-point commit on the current branch.

## Why

- The working tree had one substantive product-facing change: a historical/consolidation document that explains how the branch got here and what remains unresolved before trunk return.
- That artifact is self-contained and does not need to be split from adjacent implementation work because there is no adjacent implementation work left unstaged.
- Freezing it in one commit gives the team an auditable reference point for any later trunk-curation exercise.

## Outcome

- Commit the document together with PM bookkeeping updates.
- Use the resulting SHA as the current branch's final planning reference until new work is intentionally started.
