## Core Context

- Owns architecture, language design, and final review gates across runtime, tooling, and documentation.
- Co-owns language research with George and keeps `docs/PreceptLanguageDesign.md` aligned with actual implementation.
- Standing architecture rules: keep MCP as thin wrappers, keep docs factual, surface open decisions instead of inventing behavior, and preserve philosophy boundaries.
- Historical summary (pre-2026-04-13): drove proposal/design work for conditional guards, event hooks, verdict modifiers, modifier ordering, computed fields, and related issue-review passes; also reviewed the Squad `@copilot` lane retirement and other cross-surface contract updates.
- Owns architecture, system boundaries, and review gates across the runtime, tooling, and documentation surfaces.
- **Language Designer:** Owns Precept language design, grammar evolution, and Superpower parser strategy. `docs/PreceptLanguageDesign.md` is the foundational document.
- **Language research co-owner:** Co-owns `docs/research/language/` with George. Knows the comparative studies (xstate, Polly, FluentValidation, Zod/Valibot, LINQ, FluentAssertions, FEEL/DMN, Cedar), expression audit, verbosity analysis, and all PLT references.
- Core architectural discipline: keep MCP tools as thin wrappers, keep docs honest about implemented behavior, and document open decisions instead of inventing values.
- Technical-surface work flows through Elaine (UX), Peterman (brand compliance), Frank (architectural fit), then Shane (sign-off).
- README and brand-spec changes should reflect actual runtime semantics, not speculative future behavior.

## Recent Updates

### 2026-04-10 — Issue #31 shipped
- PR #50 merged to main (squash SHA `305ec03`). Issue #31 closed. 775 tests passing.

### 2026-04-10 - PR #50 final review — Issue #31 keyword logical operators

**Verdict: APPROVED.** All 8 slices verified. 774/774 tests passing. Full review filed at `.squad/decisions/inbox/frank-31-review.md`.

**Key architectural confirmation:** `BuildKeywordDictionary()` uses `symbol.All(char.IsLetter)` to auto-include `and`/`or`/`not` via reflection. Registered with `requireDelimiters: true` — whole-word safety against prefixes like `android` is architectural, not ad-hoc. Consistent with `contains` precedent.

**ApplyNarrowing() confirmed updated** — all three arms (`"not"`, `"and"`, `"or"`) correctly updated at their respective pattern-match sites.

**MCP is catalog-driven** — zero hardcoded operator strings. `TokenSymbol` attribute update is the only change needed; LanguageTool picks it up automatically.

**Minor non-blocking gap:** `LanguageToolTests.LogicalOperatorsAreKeywordForms` asserts `&&` and `||` are absent, but does not assert `!` is absent. Not blocking because `!` was removed from the tokenizer entirely and has no path to the inventory.

**Learnings:**
- The attribute-driven `BuildKeywordDictionary()` + `requireDelimiters` is the correct mechanism for any future operator-to-keyword migrations. No tokenizer code changes are needed — only the `[TokenSymbol]` attribute value.
- When reviewing logical operator migrations, `ApplyNarrowing()` is the easy-to-miss site — it uses pattern-match syntax (`{ Operator: "..." }` and string comparison) separately from the main type-checker switch. Both were correctly updated here.

### 2026-04-10 - Issue #31 Slice 8 docs — PreceptLanguageDesign.md sync
- Updated `docs/PreceptLanguageDesign.md` on branch `squad/31-keyword-logical-operators` to reflect #31 as fully implemented.
- **Sections updated:** (1) "Keyword vs Symbol Design Framework" — migration table heading changed from "Implementation Pending" to "Implemented", table columns renamed from "Current/Target/Pending" to "Symbolic/Keyword/Implemented", removed "Until implementation" paragraph; (2) Reserved keywords list — removed "Pending additions (#31)" note, added `and`, `or`, `not` to the main keyword list; (3) Nullability and narrowing — updated Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 code examples from `&&`/`||` to `and`/`or`, updated prose labels and inline descriptions to match; (4) Expressions section — removed `pending migration` annotations, updated `!` → `not` and `&&`/`||` → `and`/`or` in bullet list; (5) Event asserts section and Minimal Example — updated `&&` → `and` in both code examples.
- Committed as `03d50b7`, pushed to origin. PR #50 Slice 8 docs checkbox now checked.

### 2026-04-10 - Philosophy Refresh Assessment — full research corpus review
- Systematically reviewed all 32 files in `docs/research/language/` against the rewritten `docs/philosophy.md` (commits `dd14a4c` entity-first rewrite, `185e20b` governance strengthening).
- Assessment written to `docs/research/language/philosophy-refresh-assessment.md`.
- **Findings:** 16 files aligned, 14 need framing updates, 2 need significant refresh (`xstate.md`, one framing gap). No file contradicts the philosophy. Two cross-cutting problems dominate: (1) zero files use "governed integrity" — the philosophy's unifying principle; (2) 14 files don't consider data-only/stateless entities.
- Identified 4 new research gaps: constraint patterns for data-only entities, Inspect/Fire semantics for stateless instances, governance-vs-validation positioning evidence, MDM/industry-standard comparison depth.
- Recommended 16-file refresh order prioritized by impact × dependency.
- Quality bar (`computed-fields.md`) confirmed as excellent research but needs minor framing update for governed integrity language and stateless entity implications.
- Gold standard files: `entity-first-positioning-evidence.md`, `entity-modeling-surface.md`, `static-reasoning-expansion.md`.

### 2026-04-08 - PR #48 code review — data-only precepts (Slices 1–7)
- Reviewed `feature/issue-22-data-only-precepts` (commits e0eac05–833422e) against all 12 Q&A design decisions from `.squad/decisions/decisions.md`.
- **Verdict: CHANGES REQUESTED.** All 12 decisions faithfully implemented (11 PASS, 1 ISSUE — Decision 11 sample files absent). Architecture is sound; no silent drift from design.
- **Blocking issue:** `docs/PreceptLanguageDesign.md`, `docs/RuntimeApiDesign.md`, and `docs/McpServerDesign.md` are entirely missing stateless-precept documentation. This violates the project's non-negotiable doc-sync mandate.
- **Required changes:** (1) Update three design docs before merge. (2) Add multi-event C49 test (Decision 10 contract untested: 3 events → 3 separate warnings).
- **Code quality nits:** `DiagnosticCatalog.C55.MessageTemplate` used instead of `FormatMessage()` at PreceptRuntime.cs:1824; `currentState!` null-forgiving in MCP tool stateful branches; null-forgiving on `InitialState!` in `CollectCompileTimeDiagnostics` relies on implicit guard.
- **Recommendations (non-blocking):** Add explicit `IsStateless` guard before "2. Validate initial state asserts" block; add at least one sample `.precept` file (Decision 11 placeholder names are fine); add `in State edit all` engine test; replace `MessageTemplate` with `FormatMessage()` on C55.
- Full review filed at `.squad/decisions/inbox/frank-pr48-review.md`.

### 2026-04-08 - Issue #22 semantic rules review (4 spawns)
- Reviewed and rewrote #22 semantic rules for stateless precepts across 4 spawns: (1) decomposed the "states, events, and transitions forbidden" rule — states tautological, transitions structurally impossible, events the only real boundary; (2) deep analysis of stateless event boundary — confirmed binary taxonomy (data vs. behavioral), no middle tier, single-state escape hatch is correct not ceremonial; (3) warning model research — audited C48–C53 diagnostic infrastructure, external precedent survey; (4) full #22 issue body rewrite.
- **Owner decision (Shane):** events-without-states = warning (not error). C50 upgraded from hint to warning for consistency. Binary taxonomy confirmed.
- Wrote `frank-stateless-event-boundary.md` and `frank-warning-model-research.md` to decisions inbox; both merged into decisions.md by Scribe.

### 2026-04-08 - Language research corpus completed
- Closed the domain-first corpus with the final sweep in `3cc5343`, keeping `docs/research/language/domain-map.md` as the canonical map and leaving proposal bodies untouched.
- The finished corpus now spans Batch 1 `54a77da`, Batch 2 `48860ae`, and the final corpus/index pass `3cc5343`, while preserving `computed-fields.md` as the quality bar and keeping horizon domains visible.

### 2026-04-08 - Language research corpus map locked
- Preserved `docs/research/language/domain-map.md` as the canonical research-corpus map and kept the corpus organized by domain rather than by issue.
- Held the session guardrails: no proposal-body edits during corpus curation, `computed-fields.md` remains the quality bar, and horizon domains stay in scope even before proposals exist.
- The alternate map-file experiment was folded back out; Batch 1 research landed in `54a77da`, Batch 2 landed in `48860ae`, and only Batch 3 plus the final README/index sweep remain.

### 2026-04-07 - PR #35 merge: finalize README cleanup and record Squad decision
- Merged PR #35 (chore: finalize README cleanup and record Squad decision) to `main`.
- Branch `chore/upgrade-squad-latest` carried 2 commits: (1) Scribe post-task recording for PR #34 merge, and (2) README Quick Example refactoring (removed explanatory hedge, copyable DSL block, replaced markdown image syntax with fixed-width HTML img tag).
- Cleaned up merged inbox entries from `.squad/decisions/inbox/` and updated `.squad/agents/j-peterman/history.md` with team update.
- Workflow: Clean working tree before push (separated uncommitted Squad sync artifacts from committed README cleanup work), explicit PR creation with `gh pr create --base main --head sfalik:chore/upgrade-squad-latest`, merged with merge-commit strategy.
- User directive honored: branch retained locally and remotely per user request (NOT deleted post-merge).
- Verified zero scope creep: 81 additions, 3 files changed (README.md, .squad/decisions.md, .squad/agents/j-peterman/history.md), no unrelated code changes.
- Co-authored-by trailer included in original commits.

### 2026-04-07 - PR #34 merge with Squad config and README image fixes
- Merged PR #34 (chore: upgrade Squad configuration and fix README image links) to `main`.
- Branch `chore/upgrade-squad-latest` carried both architectural Squad updates and related README.md image path corrections.
- Image references corrected: `brand/readme-hero.svg` → `design/brand/readme-hero.svg` (added `design/` prefix per canonical asset layout).
- Workflow: Committed image fix with Co-authored-by trailer, pushed with `-u` for upstream tracking, created PR via `gh pr create` with explicit `--base` and `--head` flags, merged with merge-commit strategy, deleted remote branch post-merge.
- Remote branch cleaned up post-merge; no uncommitted changes remaining.
- User directive captured: keep branch open for future work (logged in decisions).
- Verified zero scope creep: only Squad config + image link fixes, no unrelated code changes.

### 2026-04-05 - Named rule proposal converged
- Reached the final proposal framing for issue #8: rule <Name> when <BoolExpr>, with reuse allowed in when, invariant, and state assert, but not on <Event> assert.
- The standing architecture filter now treats philosophy, non-programmer readability, and configuration-like legibility as explicit review criteria instead of secondary polish.

### 2026-05-01 - Expression feature research & proposals
- Produced comprehensive expression-surface research at `docs/research/dsl-expressiveness/expression-feature-proposals.md`.
- Confirmed current expression limitations via MCP compile: no ternary (`?` parse error), no `.length` on strings (PRECEPT038), no function calls, no named guards.
- Proposed 7 features across 3 waves: Wave 1 (ternary + `.length`), Wave 2 (named guards + conditional invariants), Wave 3 (`.contains()` + numeric functions), Future (computed fields).
- Extended research base beyond existing 6-library set to include FEEL/DMN, Drools DRL, and Cedar (AWS). FEEL is the strongest comparator for business-rule DSL expression design — it has ternary, string functions, numeric functions, and range membership, all of which Precept currently lacks.
- Updated `docs/research/dsl-expressiveness/README.md` with the new file entry.
- Decision note filed at `.squad/decisions/inbox/frank-expression-research.md`. No implementation authorized — Shane sign-off required per wave.

### 2026-04-05 - Proposal bodies expanded for issues #11-#13
- Expanded GitHub issues #11, #12, and #13 into fuller proposal narratives with before/after Precept examples, reference-language snippets, and explicit architectural cautions.
- Logged the wave placement and guardrails in .squad/decisions.md so the issue bodies stay aligned with keyword-anchored flat statements and first-match routing.

### 2026-04-05 - Trunk consolidation dissent logged
- Audited the repo topology and argued for force-promoting 'feature/language-redesign' to 'main' because 'main' still carries only placeholder history.
- The team did not adopt that path: Uncle Leo's review blocked direct trunk replacement, so Frank's recommendation now stands as a documented dissent pending Shane sign-off.

2026-04-05T03:20:00Z: Steinbrenner applied branch protection to main (pull requests required, force pushes/admin only, no branch deletion).

### 2026-04-08 - Issue #17 computed fields proposal revamp
- Revamped `temp/issue-body-rewrites/17.md` to incorporate all findings from the research document and all 7 team re-reviews.
- Resolved all 6 semantic contracts from the research: scope boundary, recomputation timing (Fire+Update+Inspect), nullability/accessor safety, dependency ordering, writeability/external input, tooling surface.
- Used Steinbrenner's default-if-skipped options: (a) conservative nullable rejection, (a) `.count` only for collection accessors, (a) Terraform-model external input rejection, (a) single pass after all mutations.
- Added 3 new locked decisions (#9 nullable conservative rejection, #10 external input rejection, #11 `.count`-only collection accessor restriction).
- Expanded locked decision #8 from Fire-only to all three pipelines citing George's `CommitCollections` analysis.
- Added `->` dual-use acknowledgment note to locked decision #1.
- Replaced "Open Questions: None" with a "Resolved decisions" table mapping all 6 research contracts to locked decisions.
- Changed wave from "Wave 4: Compactness + Composition" to "Composition" framing per Steinbrenner's recommendation.
- Added new sections: Tooling surface (hover, MCP compile, inspect/fire, completions), Teachable error messages (9 scenarios), Before/after example using travel-reimbursement, Interleaved fields examples, `->` reading guide callout.
- Surfaced the research's cross-category positioning claim in Motivation section.
- Added spreadsheet mental model sentence to Summary.
- Linked research document in Research and rationale links.
- Expanded Explicit exclusions with: silent default fallbacks, writable computed fields, null-coalescing operator, unsafe collection accessors. Merged fixed-point evaluation with cycle detection.
- Expanded acceptance criteria from 19 to 37 items, organized by category (parser, type checker, runtime, LS, MCP, general). Added all items from Soup Nazi's must-add and should-add lists plus Uncle Leo's blockers.
- Expanded implementation scope from 10 to 16 items covering nullable validation, accessor safety, Update pipeline, external input rejection, LS filtering, MCP specifics.

### 2026-04-08 - Issue #22 semantic rule review for Shane
- Reviewed the "states, events, and transitions forbidden in stateless precepts" semantic rule at Shane's request before implementation.
- Confirmed Shane's critique that the "states forbidden" and "transitions forbidden" parts are tautological/redundant — the real design decision is the events boundary.
- The issue body already acknowledges the tautology in the exclusions section ("this exclusion is tautological") but contradicts itself in the semantic rules section by framing it as a prohibition. Recommended rewrite to eliminate the contradiction.
- Key architectural insight: the only non-trivial semantic boundary is events. Events are forbidden because they dispatch transitions between states (a semantic dependency), not because of a tautology or structural impossibility. This is a real design choice with a potential future evolution path (stateless event-triggered mutations), deliberately closed for now.

### 2026-04-08 - Stateless event boundary deep analysis
- Shane flagged the revised #22 semantic rules as "a slippery slope." Conducted deep analysis of whether events should be forbidden in stateless precepts.
- **Recommendation: events require states. The binary taxonomy (data vs. behavioral) is correct.** The "middle tier" (data + events, no states) is a category error, not a missing feature.
- Key insight: events in Precept are not generic triggers — they are routed through states via `from State on Event -> Outcome`. The `from` is the routing context, not decoration. Events without routing are a different concept ("commands") that would need parallel syntax, semantics, and tooling.
- The single-state escape hatch (`state Active initial`) is correct, not ceremonial: it communicates "this entity has exactly one behavioral mode" — a true structural statement, not dummy ceremony. Cost: 1 line.
- Precedent survey confirms no surveyed system (Terraform, SQL, DDD, GraphQL, Protobuf) provides "data entity with named commands but no lifecycle." Every system with named commands routes them through a behavioral layer.
- The slippery slope concern is acknowledged but self-correcting: the escape hatch is cheap enough that demand for stateless events won't reach critical mass.
- Decision filed at `.squad/decisions/inbox/frank-stateless-event-boundary.md`.

## Learnings

- PR #108 code review (issue #106): APPROVED. Unified narrowing architecture is clean — bespoke `$nonneg:` loop replaced by rule iteration through `ApplyNarrowing`, zero dead code. The C76 dotted key fix (`TryGetIdentifierKey` replacing `idArg.Name`) closed a pre-existing gap for event-arg sqrt() proofs. C42 soundness comment in `TryDecomposeNullOrPattern` is the model for dependency documentation. Three non-blocking warnings: regex allocation in code action handler, missing trailing newline, and "must be nonzero" because-message on a `> 0` ensure (should say "must be positive").
- Divisor safety docs (Slice 9, #106): The `nonnegative ≠ nonzero` distinction is the most important teaching point — it's the one thing that trips authors. Context-aware C93 messaging makes it explicit. Proof sources for C76 and C93 are now unified: constraints, rules, ensures, and guards all feed the same narrowing markers (`$positive:`, `$nonneg:`, `$nonzero:`). Doc updates touched three files (language design, constraint violation, README) — RuntimeApiDesign.md was correctly scoped to public API and didn't need narrowing internals.
- Computed fields: the critical semantic contract is one recomputation pass after all mutations and before constraint evaluation.
- Modifier ordering: parser rigidity lived mostly in parser/completion surface; runtime/model layers were already largely order-independent.
- Guarded declarations: scope-inherited guards are the correct model; implementation gaps should be treated separately from design soundness.
- Docs work: `PreceptLanguageDesign.md`, editability/runtime docs, and MCP docs must stay synchronized whenever wording around constraints, updates, or inspection/editability changes.

## Recent Updates

### 2026-04-13 — Issue #88 docs sync completed for PR #90
- Reconciled the editability/documentation story across `docs/PreceptLanguageDesign.md`, `docs/EditableFieldsDesign.md`, `docs/RuntimeApiDesign.md`, and `docs/McpServerDesign.md`.
- Validation recorded on branch `squad/88-docs-reconcile-editability`: `git diff --check` and `dotnet test --no-restore`.
- Commit `9ea5609` pushed; PR #90 checklist updated and left clean for review.

### 2026-04-12 — Squad `@copilot` lane retirement contract review
- Confirmed the change is narrowly scoped to retiring the Squad-owned `squad:copilot` routing lane while preserving general repo-wide Copilot tooling.
- Required all live workflows, mirrored templates, and squad docs to agree so the lane is retired cleanly.

### 2026-04-12 — Issue #9 design review resolutions incorporated
- Folded the resolved design decisions back into the issue body, including null-handling, split diagnostics (C72/C73), and inspect trace expectations.
- Design left implementation-ready after proposal/body synchronization.
