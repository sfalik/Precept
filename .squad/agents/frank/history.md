## Core Context

- Owns language research, spec wording, and cross-surface architecture documentation for the Precept DSL and runtime.
- Catalog metadata remains the language truth; pipeline, runtime, tooling, and docs should derive from durable metadata rather than enum-identity switches or parallel lists.
- Proof, qualifier, field-state, and normalization design work must stay grounded in shipped surfaces and verified implementation seams.

## Live Guidance

- Quantity normalization now has two durable lanes: compile-time normalization for declarations and literals, runtime normalization for ingress values (`TypeRuntimeMeta.ReadJson` / `TypeRuntime<Quantity>.FromClr`). Both call the same `TypedConstantNormalizer` logic.
- `TypedField` is the normalization handshake between analysis and execution: authored bounds stay available for display, normalized bounds feed proof/comparison surfaces, and the Builder remains the conversion boundary into `PreceptValue`.
- `IntervalOf` scaling is expression-form scoped, not universal: scale static typed constants and interpolated magnitude + static-unit forms; do **not** scale field refs, arg refs, or interpolated whole-value holes.
- `GetFieldBounds` and trusted-fact extraction must read normalized quantity data, and event-arg bound normalization still needs explicit parity design.
- Compiler/runtime duplication questions should be framed through the three-layer enforcement model: compile-time diagnostics, ingress validation, and defense-in-depth runtime faults.

## Durable Learnings

- Any claim that work happens "only at compile time" must be stress-tested against Fire/Update/Restore ingress paths.
- Storage conventions for business-domain values are architectural decisions; they shape evaluator invariants and cannot be deferred casually.
- ProofEngine intervals and evaluator opcodes share source data, not a common intermediate representation.
- `PreceptValue` bytes 8-23 are a three-way union lane (`decimal`, `long`, or reference region); quantity unit identity is not blocked by the 32-byte layout.
- Prefer catalog-mediated dispatch and metadata-backed mappings over per-code hardcoded routing in both compiler and runtime consumers.
- Dynamic-unit interpolated forms MUST produce `Unbounded`/not-proved — never fall back to raw `StaticMagnitude` against normalized bounds. This is the "false proof" prevention invariant.
- When a design says "universal post-step," verify it actually means "expression-type-dispatched post-step" — the dispatch table is the contract, not the word "universal."
- Slices that depend on unimplemented runtime infrastructure (stubs) should be explicitly numbered out of the implementation sequence and marked "not implementation-ready" to prevent ordering confusion.

## Historical Summary

- 2026-05-12 through 2026-05-14 concentrated Frank's work around hover contract reviews, field-state guarantees, constructor diagnostics, interval-proof design, quantity normalization, and diagnostic-enforcement architecture.
- The durable enforcement baseline is: PRE0078 stays in ProofEngine Strategy 7, PRE0079 is the TypeChecker literal-bounds wire, PRE0019 is retired unless real presence-obligation generation is added, and PRE0094 is already emitted in the checker.
- Older batch-by-batch detail now lives in `.squad/decisions.md` and `history-archive.md`; this live file keeps only the guidance and latest outcomes other agents need immediately.

## Recent Updates

### 2026-05-15T01:37:41Z — External normalization research merged

- Frank-7 validated the quantity-normalization design against F#, Rust/uom, JSR-385, FHIR/UCUM, Modelica, and decimal interval-arithmetic practice; the architecture stays sound, with only medium-priority documentation follow-ups around nonlinear-unit exclusion and exact-decimal conversion assumptions.
- Frank-8 confirmed business units (each, box, package, related count units) already normalize correctly by construction via factor-1 UCUM atoms and shared count dimension semantics; no code-path change is needed.
- Scribe merged both research records into .squad/decisions/decisions.md, deleted the inbox notes, and logged the combined batch in the orchestration/session records.



### 2026-05-14T17:37:50.029-04:00 — Design doc resolution pass: all 6 conditions resolved

- Completed the design document resolution pass on `docs/Working/quantity-normalization-design.md`, resolving all six §5.5.6 conditions in a single edit pass.
- **Condition 1:** SUPERSEDED markers verified on §3.6, §3.7, §7 Q2 — §0's "store both" is the single authoritative bounds-storage design.
- **Condition 2:** Replaced "universal post-step" in §0 Q6 with expression-type-dispatched `TryGetStaticScalingFactor` pseudocode. Added constraint table showing which expression types scale vs. which are excluded. This is the critical double-normalization prevention mechanism.
- **Condition 3:** Added `GetFieldBounds` fix to Slice 16 spec — reads `NormalizedDeclaredMin ?? DeclaredMin` with null fallback.
- **Condition 4:** Added `TryGetStaticNumericValue` fix to Slice 16 spec — normalizes `StaticMagnitude` via `TryGetStaticScalingFactor` before returning trusted facts.
- **Condition 5:** Decided Option (a) for `TypedEventArg` — parallel `NormalizedDeclaredMin/Max` fields, architecturally consistent with `TypedField`. Added Slice 15b spec.
- **Condition 6:** Updated `NumericInterval.Scale` to `Scale(decimal factor)` in Revised Key Types and Slice 14. Factor conversion happens once in `TryGetStaticScalingFactor`.
- Added §5.6 Extended Slice Details (Slices 22–26) from George's gap audit with full objective/files/approach/tests/dependencies for each.
- Replaced George's §0.6 header with Frank's Design Resolution Summary including the condition resolution table and implementation gate clearance.
- Key pattern: the `TryGetStaticScalingFactor` helper is the single dispatch point for all expression-type → scaling-factor decisions. This is the design's core invariant — one function, one place, no scattered switching.

### 2026-05-14T17:10:32.283-04:00 — Interpolated normalization review closed with approval conditions

- Completed the exhaustive architectural review of `docs/Working/quantity-normalization-design.md` and approved the direction **with conditions**.
- Locked the design correction that §0 supersedes the competing §3.6 / §3.7 / §7 Q2 descriptions, so the doc must carry one canonical bounds-storage story.
- Confirmed the key follow-up requirements: expression-form-scoped `IntervalOf` scaling, normalized reads in `GetFieldBounds`, normalized `StaticMagnitude` in trusted-fact extraction, and a decision on event-arg bound parity.
- Cross-agent note: George's exhaustive gap audit proves Slices 19-21 are necessary but not exhaustive; implementation planning must account for the wider interpolated qualifier/default surface.

### 2026-05-14T17:10:32.283-04:00 — Diagnostic enforcement alignment recorded as a three-layer model

- Confirmed the enforcement mission did **not** compound compiler/runtime duplication; most wired diagnostics are compile-time-only structural checks.
- Recorded the canonical three-layer model: compiler diagnostics, ingress validation, and defense-in-depth faults linked through `[StaticallyPreventable]`.
- Captured two durable follow-ups: ingress validation should become a deliberate surface for quantity/choice/dynamic-qualifier checks, and catalog-mediated dispatch remains the preferred alignment pattern.
- Preserved the companion implementation-notes record so future sessions can recover enforcement reality without re-auditing the mission.

### 2026-05-14T17:48:42.442-04:00 — Doc-sync slice (Slice 27) added to quantity normalization design

- Audited all canonical documentation surfaces for staleness after quantity normalization (Slices 14–21).
- **Needs updates:** `docs/language/precept-language-spec.md` (§0.6 + §5 — add unit-aware normalization to proof engine contract), `docs/compiler/proof-engine.md` (obligation record, interval source table, Strategy 6 normalization), `docs/Working/interval-proof-engine-design.md` (tracker cross-ref, interval table annotations, obligation parameter annotations), `docs/runtime/runtime-api.md` (three-layer enforcement model from §0.5 needs a canonical home), MCP DTO (`CompileProofObligationDto` gains `NormalizedDeclaredMin/Max`).
- **Confirmed clean:** `docs/language/catalog-system.md` (catalog describes types, not comparison behavior), `README.md` (no quantity/normalization content), `docs/philosophy.md` (no scope change), `samples/` (bug fix is in compiler, samples unchanged), `docs/mcp/` (directory doesn't exist).
- The three-layer enforcement model (compile-time / ingress / defense-in-depth) identified in §0.5 is the most significant doc gap — it's a named architectural concept without a canonical home in the published docs.

### 2026-05-15T00:08:25Z — Typed-constant null-guard decision locked to the proof layer

- Locked the `samples/Test.precept` null-guard gap to PRE0116 via ProofEngine presence obligations rather than a new TypeChecker error.
- Recommended reverting `samples/Test.precept` to its clean literal form and keeping interpolation coverage in a dedicated sample if needed.
- George's adjacent implementation fix (commit `ae19510f`) now lands on the exact traversal gap Frank identified: `TypedInterpolatedTypedConstant` holes must be walked like other optional value reads.

## Learnings

### 2026-05-14T17:51 — PRE0027 Diagnosis: No Errors Found
- Investigated suspected PRE0027 (DuplicateArgName) errors in sample files. Result: **no PRE0027 errors exist** anywhere in the repository.
- The actual error in `samples/Test.precept` is PRE0078 (interval overflow), which is pre-existing — the literal `6 [lb_av]` already violated `max '5 kg'` before George's edit.
- George's modification (changing `'6 [lb_av]'` to `'{test2} [lb_av]'`) changed the proof shape from concrete-interval to unbounded-interval but did not introduce a new error category.
- Recommendation: revert Test.precept; if interpolated-quantity test cases are needed for normalization work, create a new sample with satisfiable bounds.

### 2026-05-14T20:47 — Event-arg default gap is bounded, not broad
- George's B26 finding ("broader than normalization") is technically correct but practically overstated. The parser and name-binder already capture `default` modifiers on event args via `DeclaredArg.ParsedModifiers`. The `TypedArg.DefaultExpression` slot exists. The only missing piece is a `ResolveEventArgExpressions` pass (~40 lines) calling the same `Resolve()` infrastructure used for fields.
- The "Slice 2+" comment at TypeChecker.cs:527 confirms this was always a planned addition, not a design gap.
- When evaluating "is this too broad?" claims, check whether the parser/binder layers already captured the raw data — if they did, the checker gap is mechanical, not architectural.
- Diagnosis written to `.squad/decisions/inbox/frank-pre0027-diagnosis.md`.

### 2026-05-14T20:35:04.819-04:00 — George's technical review disposition: all findings accepted

- Reviewed George's per-slice technical review of `docs/Working/quantity-normalization-design.md` (APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS verdict).
- **Zero rejections.** All 15 findings accepted or accepted-with-modification.
- Key decisions locked:
  - B16's dynamic-unit fallback prohibition is the highest-value safety constraint — `TryGetStaticNumericValue` must return `false` for dynamic-unit forms, never raw `StaticMagnitude`.
  - B22's duplicate Slice 22 resolved: runtime ingress moved to Phase 3 deferred; static qualifier capture keeps the Slice 22 number.
  - B25's path chosen: stronger FoldValue as primary + dedicated default-obligation collector as secondary (NOT DynamicObligationGenerator).
  - B26 extracted to separate issue — event-arg defaults are a compiler feature gap, not normalization scope.
  - B19: Slices 19 and 22 remain separate (not folded) — different problems, compose rather than merge.
- Factual correction applied throughout: `TypedEventArg` → `TypedArg` (the actual type name in `SemanticIndex.cs`).
- Ordering locked: `14 → 15+15b → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 → 21 → 22 → 23 → 24 → 25 → 27 → 26`.
- Decision record written to `.squad/decisions/inbox/frank-normalization-george-review.md`.

### 2026-05-14T20:47:51-04:00 — Slice 26 reinstated in-track (Shane direction)

- Shane directed Slice 26 (event-arg default resolution) back into the quantity normalization track.
- Source analysis confirmed George's concern was valid (the plumbing IS missing) but the scope is bounded: `DeclaredArg.ParsedModifiers` already carries `default` modifiers from the parser, `TypedArg.DefaultExpression` slot exists, the `Resolve()` call is available. Only a ~40-line `ResolveEventArgExpressions` pass is needed.
- Scoped to typed-constant defaults for quantity/money/price args — NOT general expression defaults.
- Updated §0.7 disposition table, ordering (now `25 → 27 → 26`), and risk item 5.
- Decision record written to `.squad/decisions/inbox/frank-slice26-reinclusion.md`.
