## Core Context

- Owns test discipline across parser, type checker, runtime, MCP, and language-server validation.
- Keeps behavioral claims tied to executable proof and records gaps as actionable test findings, not just counts.
- Historical summary (pre-2026-04-13): led broad verification for declaration guards, including parser/type-checker/runtime/LS/MCP coverage and test-matrix planning for guarded editability.

## Learnings

- Compile-time/default-data behavior must be tested explicitly whenever new guard semantics are introduced.
- Guard scope rules need separate coverage for field-scoped and arg-scoped contexts.
- Regression risk is highest where hydration, editability, and inspect/update paths share runtime machinery.

## Recent Updates

### 2026-04-11 — Guarded declaration validation sweep
- Built and verified multi-layer tests for guarded invariants, state asserts, event asserts, and guarded edit blocks, including runtime and MCP coverage.
