# Language Theory and Reference Research

This directory is the theory and reference companion to the domain packets in `../expressiveness/`.

Use it when you need formal grounding, precedent from language theory, or a principled boundary for what should stay out of scope.

## Reference index

| File | Domain grounded | Open proposals | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| [type-system-survey.md](./type-system-survey.md) | Type system expansion and type-system follow-ons | `#25`, `#26`, `#27`, `#29` | Formal type-model, coercion, scalar semantics, and cross-system precedent for the expanded type surface. |
| [constraint-composition.md](./constraint-composition.md) | Constraint composition | `#8`, `#13`, `#14` | Predicate-combinator theory, scope boundaries, and desugaring model for rules and field constraints. |
| [conditional-invariant-survey.md](./conditional-invariant-survey.md) | Constraint composition | `#14` | Why guarded declarations should read as positive conditions instead of formal implication syntax. |
| [expression-evaluation.md](./expression-evaluation.md) | Expression expansion and computed-field semantics | `#9`, `#10`, `#15`, `#16`, `#17`, `#31` | Decidability map for expression growth and bounded-function design. |
| [expression-compactness.md](./expression-compactness.md) | Event ingestion shorthand and future compactness work | `#11` | Desugaring and shorthand boundaries for keeping compact syntax inspectable. |

| [state-machine-expressiveness.md](./state-machine-expressiveness.md) | Transition shorthand | — | Statechart and state-machine precedent for what Precept should and should not borrow. |
| [static-reasoning-expansion.md](./static-reasoning-expansion.md) | Static reasoning expansion | — | Horizon-domain grounding for contradiction detection, deadlock analysis, and interval-first reasoning. |
